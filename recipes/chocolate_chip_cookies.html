    <h3>Who doesn't love a nice soft homemade chocolate chip cookie though?</h3>
    <p>Did you just love those chocolate chip cookies your friend's mom would always make on the weekends? The cookies someone would inevitably bring to a church gathering or choir performance?</p>
    <p>Well, being able to make these cookies quickly and easily is a real crowd-pleasing skill that I intend to share with you here.</p>
    <p>I hope you enjoyed my [always short] blog entry. I really don't like writing things at length anyways.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3/4 cups white sugar</li>
            <li>3/4 cups brown sugar (nobody cares whether it's light or dark)</li>
            <li>2 sticks of butter, softened or melted it's whatever</li>
            <li>2 eggies</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla</li>
            <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp salt (if you used salted butter, you can omit this)</li>
            <li>2 1/4 cups all purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips, I don't care about brand as long as they're semi-sweet. I usually get ghirardelli.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Making them Cookie Babies</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Pre-heat the oven to 375ÂºF.</li>
            <li>With an electric mixer or good whisk if the butter is melted, mix the sugars with the butter until "fluffy", whatever that means.</li>
            <li>Add the eggs. Add the vanilla. Mix everything again for like 10/15 seconds.</li>
            <li>Add the baking soda, salt, and like 2/3 cups of flour. Mix all that together until the flour is mostly combined, add more flour and keep mixing. Repeat the process until all the flour is mixed in. You'll have a pretty thick dough.</li>
            <li>Now mix in a bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips. Semi-sweet or bust, you hear?</li>
            <li>Scoop the dough onto a cookie sheet. Teaspoon sized balls? However big you want those cookies is cool.</li>
            <li>Bake for 8-10 minutes. Follow your heart. Make sure they're not in too long or else they'll just be crunchy and boring.</li>
        </ol>
