    <h1>Sourdough Bread Recipe (Well, the recipe is simple, the process is long.)</h1>
    <h2>Sourdough Bread Process</h2>

    <h3>Get basic. Revel in it. Cause sourdough is basic and yet thrilling AF.</h3>
    <p>We all started a sourdough starter during the pandemic. Only the tried ant true have kept at it for the full 2 years since it's started.</p>
    <p>Credit where credit is due though, the most hardcore of us were the ones who had been making sourdough with their own starter since before all this madness even began. Hats off to you all.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>400g bread flour</li>
            <li>100g whole wheat flour</li>
            <li>10g salt</li>
            <li>340g room temp filter water</li>
            <li>60g happy bubbly sourdough starter</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Process</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the dry ingredients, then whisk together the water and starter, and pour it into the flour/salt mixture. Combine with your hands.</li>
            <li>Cover loosely and let this freshly mixed dough autolyze for about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Now starts the bulk rise. Stretch and fold the autolyzed dough until it's a nice smooth ball. Let that sit for about an hour and come back to stretch and fold more.</li>
            <li>Repeat stretch and folds ever hour or so, and let the dough rise to about 1.5 to twice its original size. This could take a few hours, it could take 8 hours. All depends on the environment.</li>
            <li>When your dough is risen enough in its bulk rise, we're going to shape it on the counter. Sprinkle some flour on the clean counter and work the dough on the counter top, doing more strethc and folds until it's a nice ball. Cover with a tea towel and leave it crease side-down on the counter top for about half an hour to let it set in its shape.</li>
            <li>Now is time for the second rise! Take the tea towel that was covering the dough on the counter and put it in a bowl that fits the dough snugly but offers a little room for rise, crease side up now. Loosely fold the towel over the dough and let sit another ~45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pre-heat the oven to 450ºF. Flip the dough onto parchment paper from the bowl, using a very sharp knife, cut lines in the top of the dough for moisture to escape while it's cooking. I like to make a little pattern, do whatever you like as long as there are cuts for moisture to escape from. Otherwise the crust will just tear while baking.</li>
            <li>Put the dough still on the parchment paper into a dutch oven, cover it and put it in the oven at 450º for about 12 minutes.</li>
            <li>Turn the oven heat down to about 415ºF for another 12 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the lid from the baking bread and set the timer for another 35 minutes.</li>
            <li>When the bread is a nice golden russet color, the bread is ready to come out. Let it cool for a long time before cutting into it.</li>
