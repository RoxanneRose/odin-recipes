    <h3>These grape leaves are stuffed with a savory rice and beef filling.</h3>
    <p>Most people think of the Greek Dolmas when they hear the words &quot;grape leaves&quot;, but having been raised Lebanese, I tend to think of a slightly different dish. The grape leaves that I was raised eating are traditionally stuffed with rice and lamb, but for the sake of our health we use beef (much better right?!).</p>
    <p>What you will find when you have a rice-and-meat stuffed grape leaf is a completely different flavor profile, one with a little more spice and lemon involved, and a bit less garlic. It's magic, I tell you. And since I hate long blog posts about the cooking process, here's the recipe. I'll add tips and tricks to the bottom if you're interested.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Jar of Grape Leaves (Orlando is a fine brand)</li>
            <li>2 lbs ground beef (I use 85/15 organic grass-fed)</li>
            <li>1 cup basmati or jasmine rice</li>
            <li>2 tsp cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 tsp allspice</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 tsp black pepper</li>
            <li>juice from 1/2 a lemon</li>
            <li>2 or 3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>lemon slices</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

        <h3>Putting It All Together</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse and cut the stems off every grape leaf you plan to use. Some will be too ripped, small, damaged somehow to use for wrapping. Use those to line the bottom of the pot you will be cooking with.</li>
            <li>Mix together all the filling ingredients - I use my hands to mash everything up nicely.</li>
            <li>Stuff the grape leaves. Place a leaf in front of you with the tips of the leaf facing away from you. Place a small log-shape of filling on the base of the leaf. This is much easier to show with pictures. I use my pointer finger to guage how much to use. Fold the sides of the leaf over the edges of the filling and slowly roll the leaf up from the bottom. This will create a small wrapping for the filling. Place in the pot snugly with other grape leaves and continue.</li>
            <li>When a full layer of grape leaves has been put in the pot and you need to start packing more on top, slice the lemon very thinly, add 3 lemon slices and about a clove's worth of garlic slices to the pot, sprinkling evenly, and a dash of salt and pepper. Then begin layering the leaves.</li>
            <li>After you've stuffed all the grape leaves and the pot is as filled as it will be, take a plate that fits snugly into the pot, tie a string around it so you can get it out later, and put it face down over the leaves in the pot.</li>
            <li>Fill a bowl with water and place it on top of the upside-down plate in the pot. Now fill the pot with water to the base of this bowl. This acts as a weight while the water is boiling, keeping the grape leaves from roiling around in the water and unravelling willy-nilly.</li>
        </ol>
